# Advent Of Code - Kyllian Beguin
Welcome on my [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions repository !  
I will provide solutions for python, golang, and bash ! As I am using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as code editor, I will provide the configuration file to you in the [/config](./config) folder.  
I might not do every challenges, but I found it a great opportunity to learn more golang, improve my python, and have fun with some bash :D  
If you found this repository usefull for you, feel free to give a ⭐ !
